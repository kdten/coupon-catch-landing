This app was developed with a vision to launch into app stores in the future. After discussing Expo, Ionic React was chosen in favor of singlifying development to a single codebase. Google Cloud Document AI leverages basic OCR features while a custom algorithm on the Express backend assigns data to the receipts. The Node Express backend also handles Stripe API including triggering webhooks.

## Optimizations

* Implemented AWS Codepipeline for CI/CD decreasing development time.
* Ionic React produces Apple, Android and Web App from singular codebase.
* Reduced Largest Contentful Paint from 1.2 seconds to .65 seconds.

## Lessons Learned:

Devops is a whole other ballgame. It's one thing to build it, but it's another to make sure it has high availability and scalability. This project was started with a now deprecated service, which added delay to our schedule, showing one should never rely on anything working forever.
